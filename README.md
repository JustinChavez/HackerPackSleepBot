# Master Oogway Slack Wakeup Bot

Based on the hit movie Kung Fu Panda

This bot is able to contact the members of your slack team at a designated time to ask if they are awake. If the members do not respond with the specific command to Master Oogway, then at a designated later time Master Oogway will publish their information so the other team members may wake up the sleeping members.
